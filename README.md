# pyrogi

One of many tasty dishes from my home country is pierÃ³g, in english known as `dumpling` ðŸ¥Ÿ. I cannot fathom how many of them I have eaten in my entire life. 

As a programmer, it is my sacred duty to write new projects and bring crazy ideas into life. What is a better way to combine those two?

pyrogi is a framework for moving raw data to datalake.


## What is a pyrog?

One pyrog (pierÃ³g/dumpling) is a unit of data that will be further transferred into a datalake.
The size of it may vary, this is **to be determined**.

## What is a pot with boiling water?

Itâ€™s a datalake. Pot with *water*, data *lake*, get it? <br>

## Setup
Once you clone the repo, start the program by using the start script with `./startup.sh` command.
